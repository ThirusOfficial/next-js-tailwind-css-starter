This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`] and Tailwind CSS installed with 'JIT mode'.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

In another terminal window, run:

```bash
npm run build:css
```

This will watch your changes and build your CSS file using Tailwind CSS

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
